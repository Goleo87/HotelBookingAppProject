# Custom Project

Use this repo to create your own custom project!

As part of your project, you should try to practice as many of the things we have learned during the "Programming Basics" module as you can.

Don't forget to also update this `README.md` file, to document the goals of your project, and give any useful information that a user may need to know. :smile:

## Note

This repo includes `readline-sync`, in case you want to get user input from the terminal.
- See the starter code in `solution.js` for a reminder of how `readline-sync` works.
- You do not have to use `readline-sync` if you do not need to!
- **Remember:** you will need to run `npm install` in the terminal before you can start using `readline-sync`!
